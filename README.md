# coi-label-web-interface
A supporting project for my Bachelor's Thesis.
I conducted a research to detect the presence of Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework elements in an asynchronous discussion held in MOOC (Massive Open Online Course). Simply put, I gathered the discussion data and manually label the presence of CoI framework using this web app. The tech stack I used in this project is mostly **Java Spring framework**.
